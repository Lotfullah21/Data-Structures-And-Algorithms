## Equal 0, 1 and 2:

Given a string str of length N which consists of only 0, 1 or 2s, count the number of substring which have equal number of 0s, 1s and 2s.

`Time Complexity`:O(N) = O(N).
`Space Complexity`: we are using spaces for keeping prefix and hashmap count and we are not returning them as our answer, so, O(N) + O(N) = O(N).
