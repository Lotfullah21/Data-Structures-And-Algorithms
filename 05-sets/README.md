## Variables

variables can either local or global.

the variable outside the functions can be accessed inside the functions but cannot be edited, in other words just for read operation.

if we want to value of a variable, we need to mention it explicitly that the variable is global using ```py global variableName``` inside each function that we want to edit it.
