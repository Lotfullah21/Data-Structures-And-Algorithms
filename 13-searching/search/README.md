#### Question:

Given an array of elements, find if target K is present in the array; if the target is present return True.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12]
K = 7
Output: True
Explanation: 7 is present in the array, hence it returns true.

#### Idea-1: Linear Search

take the target and compare it to each element in the array, if they are equal return True.

#### Analysis:

#### Idea-1

`Time Complexity` is `O(N)`, Traversing the whole array if the target is not present or at last index..

`Space Complexity` is `O(1)`, no extra space used.

#### Idea-1

`Time Complexity` is `O(logN)`.
