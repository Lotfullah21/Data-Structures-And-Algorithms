## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just want to strengthen your understanding of DSA concepts, you'll find a variety of topics covered here.

Each folder corresponds to a specific DSA topic, containing solutions in python programming language. Feel free to explore and use these solutions for learning and reference purposes.
Within each folder, you'll find solutions to general DSA problems as well as solutions to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/?difficulty=EASY&page=1&topicSlugs=array">LeetCode</a> problems related to that topic.
