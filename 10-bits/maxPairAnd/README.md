### Question:

Given an array arr[] of N positive integers. Find the Maximum AND Value generated by any pair(arr1, arr2) from a given array such that i != j.

### Idea-1:

Go through each element and take do `bitwise and` operation, return the one with the highest value.

#### Analysis:

`Time Complexity` is `O(N)` as we are checking every element.
`Space Complexity` is `O(1)` as we are not using any additional spaces.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxPairAnd(self,arr: list) -> list:
        max1 = float("-inf")
        n = len(arr)
        max1_idx = -1
        max2_idx = -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if arr[i]&arr[j]>max1:
                    max1 = arr[i]&arr[j]
                    max1_idx = i
                    max2_idx = j
        print(max2_idx, max1_idx)
        return arr[max1_idx]&arr[max2_idx]


solution = Solution()
arr = [4, 8, 12, 16, 8, 12,13]
result = solution.maxPairAnd(arr)
print(result)

```

#### Idea-2:

remove the elements with least ones on the left hand side at each iteration if count of the elements having `1` are greater than two.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxPairAnd(self,arr: list) -> list:
        n = len(arr)
        # Find the most significant bit from left to right.
        for i in range(31, -1, -1):
            count = 0
            for j in range(n):
                if self.checkBit(arr[j], i)==True:
                    count+=1
            # If count of element which have set bit is >=2, remove them or fill it with zero, we need only two to compare.
            if count>=2:
                for j in range(n):
                    if self.checkBit(arr[j], i)== False:
                        arr[j]=0
        print(arr)
        idx1 = -1
        idx2 = -1
        # From the remaining elements which their values did not become zero, choose two elements and do bitwise and operation.
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i]>0 and idx1 ==-1:
                idx1 = i
            elif arr[i]>0 and idx1!=-1:
                idx2 = i
                break
        return arr[idx1]&arr[idx2]
    # To find the set bit, do the bitwise and operation.
    def checkBit(self, N, i):
        if N&(1<<i)!=0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

solution = Solution()
arr = [4, 8, 12, 16]
result = solution.maxPairAnd(arr)
print(result)
```

#### Analysis:

`Time Complexity` is `O(32*N)` = `O(N)` as we are checking only 32 bits in outer loop and each element inside the array.
`Space Complexity` is `O(1)` as we are not using any additional spaces.
