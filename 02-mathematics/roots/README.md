#### Question:

Given a quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c. Find its roots.

#### Idea-1:

The idea is to use Sridharacharya Formula for finding roots of quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c =0.

The values of the roots depends on the term (b2 – 4ac) which is known as the discriminant (D).
If D > 0:
=> This occurs when b2 > 4ac.
=> The roots are real and unequal.
=> The roots are {-b + √(b2 – 4ac)}/2a and {-b – √(b2 – 4ac)}/2a.
Else If D = 0:
=> This occurs when b2 = 4ac.
=> The roots are real and equal.
=> The roots are (-b/2a).
Else if D < 0:
=> This occurs when b2 < 4ac.
=> The roots are imaginary and unequal.
