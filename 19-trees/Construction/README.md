## Tree Construction

We will be given postOrder or preOrder traversal and inOrder traversal of a tree to build a the tree from them.
Without inOrder list, the tree cannot be build, so presence of either preOrder or postOrder and inOrder is a must.

Two kind of questions can be given:

1. Build a tree from preOrder and inOrder.
2. Build a tree from postOrder and inOrder.
