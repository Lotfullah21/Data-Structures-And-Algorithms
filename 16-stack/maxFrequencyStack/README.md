self.freqMap.get(val, 0) is a Python dictionary method. It returns the value for val if val is in the dictionary self.freqMap, and if val is not found, it returns the default value 0.

#### Analysis:

`Time Complexity` is `O(N)`, for each operation.
`Space Complexity` is `O(N)` for hashmap space we use to keep the stacks and frequencies.
