## Time Complexity:

time complexity of `Brute force solution` is O(N^2) and its space complexity is O(1); This is because one nested loop is used inside the outer loop.
time complexity of `runningSumInPlace` and `runningSumPf` is O(N) and its space complexity is O(1); This is because, there is only one loop.

output and input are not considered in space complexity.
