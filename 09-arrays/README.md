<code>arr = list(map(int, input().split()))</code>

input(): This function takes user input from the console. Whatever the user types is treated as a string.

split(): This method is called on the input string and is used to split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines). If no specific separator is provided to the split() method, it defaults to splitting on whitespace.

map(int, ...): This is a combination of the map() function and the int constructor. It applies the int function to each element (substring) in the list obtained from the split() method. This is necessary because, by default, the elements obtained from input().split() are of type string, and we want them to be integers.

list(...): Finally, the list() constructor is used to convert the result of the map() operation into a list.

So, in summary, this line of code takes a space-separated input from the user, converts the input into a list of strings, then maps the int function to convert each string element into an integer, and finally, stores the resulting list of integers in the variable arr. This is a common way to take a list of integers as input in a single line

<code> dx1, idx2 = map(int, input().split()) </code>

This line of code is used to take two integer inputs from the user, separated by whitespace (typically, spaces). Let's break it down:

input(): This function takes user input from the console. Whatever the user types is treated as a string.

split(): This method is called on the input string and is used to split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines). If no specific separator is provided to the split() method, it defaults to splitting on whitespace.

map(int, ...): Similar to the previous explanation, this applies the int function to each element (substring) in the list obtained from the split() method, converting them from strings to integers.

idx1, idx2 = ...: The result of the map() operation is then unpacked into the variables idx1 and idx2. This assumes that the user has entered two integers separated by whitespace. If more than two values are entered, or if non-integer values are entered, it would raise a ValueError.

```py


def main():

    n = int(input(""))
    arr = list(map(int, input("").split()))
    ans = maxPair(arr)
    print(ans)

def maxPair(arr):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(0,len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if (arr[i]*arr[j])>ans:
                print(arr[i],arr[j])
                ans = arr[i]*arr[j]
    return ans

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
