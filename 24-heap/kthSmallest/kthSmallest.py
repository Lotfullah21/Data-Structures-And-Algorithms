"""Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. 
It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Input:

arr[] = 2 3 4 5 6 7 
K = 3

Output : 4
Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 4.
