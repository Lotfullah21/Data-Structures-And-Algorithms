### Question:

Given an array of integers and a sum value X, find if there is a pair such that the summation of those pairs results to X.

### Idea-1:

Use two nested loops and check for every possible combination.

```py

```

### Analysis:

`Time Complexity`:`O(n^2)`, where n is the number of elements in the array.
`Space Complexity`:`O(1)`.

### Idea-2:

Use hashmap or set.

`Time Complexity`:`O(n)`, where n is the number of elements in the array.
`Space Complexity`:`O(n)`.
