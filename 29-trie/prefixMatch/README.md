## Prefix match with other strings

Given an array of strings arr[] of size n, a string str and an integer k. The task is to find the count of strings in arr[] whose prefix of length k matches with the k-length prefix of str.
in another words, count how many words in a list start with a given prefix of length k.

## Prefix:

A prefix is a sequence of characters at the beginning of a string. For example, in the word "apple," the prefixes include "a," "ap," "app," "appl," and "apple." Prefixes are useful in many applications, such as auto-completion, dictionary searches, and text processing.

## Example:

"apple" -> starts with "app"
"app" -> starts with "app"
"apricot" -> does not start with "app"
"banana" -> does not start with "app"
"bat" -> does not start with "app"
"bar" -> does not start with "app"
"barn" -> does not start with "app"
