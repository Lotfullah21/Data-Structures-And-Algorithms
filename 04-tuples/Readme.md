## Tuples ()
tuples are ordered sequences of elements.

- items can have different types
- items inside tuples can be accessed using their indices
- order does not mean they should be in order, but the data can be accessed using indexing.
- they are immutable, once created, the elements inside tuples cannot be modified

represented with `()`

```py
new_tuple = ()
```
