## Question:

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

## Analysis:

`Time Complexity`: O(n-k+1)\*O(k).
`Space Complexity`: O(1).
